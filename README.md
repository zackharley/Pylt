# Pylt {

## Getting Started

Before you begin using Pylt, you must have Node.js 7.0+ installed on your computer. You must also have the Yarn package manager installed on your computer, which can be done by typing `npm i -g yarn` into your terminal.

After cloning the repository, you must install the dependencies of the project:
```
$ yarn install
```

You can then build the project:
```
$ npm start
```
This will host the application on port 8000 by default, but another port can be exposed:
```
$ export PORT=8080
```
